# School_District_Analysis
# Overview
According to the school board, there is evidence of academic dishonesty with reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders that appear to have been altered.  The purpose of the project is to analyze data provided by the school board before and after possible academic dishonesty, where the data for Thomas High School 9th grade has been kept for the purpose of analysis. Maria replaced Thomas High School's math and reading scores with NaN, while keeping the rest of the data intact. At the end of the analysis, Maria compared the data before and after making this change to draw conclusions.
